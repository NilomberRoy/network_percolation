# MDA_percolation
This program simulates percolation on a Mediation Driven Attachment (MDA) network, where the network is grown by adding new nodes that attach via a mediator node to m randomly selected neighbors, resulting in a heterogeneous topology. After the MDA network is built, a percolation process is performed using the product rule of Achlioptas process—at each step, M bonds are compared and the one minimizing the product of connecting cluster sizes is chosen—tracking the evolution of clusters, entropy, and order parameters to study the percolation transition and critical properties of the MDA network. Simulation results (e.g., largest cluster, entropy, susceptibility) are output for further analysis.
  
# ER_percolation
This program simulates a percolation process on a random network of N nodes, where at each step, M random pairs of nodes are considered and the pair whose merging minimizes the product of their cluster sizes is connected (the product rule, related to explosive percolation). The simulation tracks the growth of clusters, specifically monitoring the size of the largest cluster, entropy, and other statistical properties as edges are added, thereby modeling the critical behavior and phase transition in network connectivity. Results are output for further analysis of quantities such as entropy, susceptibility, and largest cluster size during the percolation process.

# BA_percolation
This program simulates percolation on a Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network, where the network is grown by adding new nodes that attach to m existing nodes via preferential attachment, generating a heterogeneous (power-law) degree distribution. After the BA network is constructed, a percolation process is carried out using the product rule of the Achlioptas process: at each step, M bonds are compared and the bond minimizing the product of connecting cluster sizes is selected, enabling the study of explosive percolation, cluster evolution, entropy, and order parameters. Simulation outputs, including largest cluster size, entropy, and susceptibility, are produced for further analysis of the percolation transition and critical phenomena in scale-free networks.

# MDA_FvsN_upto_tNalpha
This program implements the powder-keg process from the work of Friedman and Landsberg, simulating percolation on a network built via mediation-driven attachment (MDA). At each step, M candidate bonds are compared and the bond that minimizes the product of the sizes of the clusters it would join is selected (the product rule), driving an explosive percolation transition. The simulation tracks the emergence and sizes of large clusters, and specifically computes the fraction F of nodes in clusters larger than \(N^β\) after t_Nalpha edges have been added, providing insight into powder-keg phenomena and the critical properties of cluster formation. Here, **α (alpha)** is a tunable exponent that sets the time threshold \(t_{N^\alpha}\) (i.e., the number of edges added is  \(N^alpha\) , controlling when the measurement of large cluster fraction F is taken—allowing the study of early or late-time percolation behavior. 

# Convolution_updated
Convolution is used in this program to smooth simulation data and reduce statistical noise by averaging each data point with its neighbors, resulting in clearer trends and more interpretable curves. This technique is especially important in percolation studies, where raw data can be noisy due to the stochastic nature of the process. By applying convolution, as described in the influential paper by Newman and Ziff, the code produces smoother and more accurate representations of physical observables, such as cluster size distributions or order parameters, across varying probabilities or system sizes. This makes it easier to identify critical behavior and underlying patterns in the data.
