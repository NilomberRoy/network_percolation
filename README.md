# MDA_percolation
This program simulates percolation on a Mediation Driven Attachment (MDA) network, where the network is grown by adding new nodes that attach via a mediator node to m randomly selected neighbors, resulting in a heterogeneous topology. After the MDA network is built, a percolation process is performed using the product rule of Achlioptas process—at each step, M bonds are compared and the one minimizing the product of connecting cluster sizes is chosen—tracking the evolution of clusters, entropy, and order parameters to study the percolation transition and critical properties of the MDA network. Simulation results (e.g., largest cluster, entropy, susceptibility) are output for further analysis.
  
# ER_percolation
This program simulates a percolation process on a random network of N nodes, where at each step, M random pairs of nodes are considered and the pair whose merging minimizes the product of their cluster sizes is connected (the product rule, related to explosive percolation). The simulation tracks the growth of clusters, specifically monitoring the size of the largest cluster, entropy, and other statistical properties as edges are added, thereby modeling the critical behavior and phase transition in network connectivity. Results are output for further analysis of quantities such as entropy, susceptibility, and largest cluster size during the percolation process.

# BA_percolation
This program simulates percolation on a Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network, where the network is grown by adding new nodes that attach to m existing nodes via preferential attachment, generating a heterogeneous (power-law) degree distribution. After the BA network is constructed, a percolation process is carried out using the product rule of the Achlioptas process: at each step, M bonds are compared and the bond minimizing the product of connecting cluster sizes is selected, enabling the study of explosive percolation, cluster evolution, entropy, and order parameters. Simulation outputs, including largest cluster size, entropy, and susceptibility, are produced for further analysis of the percolation transition and critical phenomena in scale-free networks.
